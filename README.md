## What I do

I spend most of my time building backends that quietly keep things running — APIs, systems, pipelines. Lately I've been dragging AI into everything I touch: computer vision, LLM-powered tools, automation layers on top of things that were never meant to be automated.

10+ years in, and I still get that itch when a problem walks in without an obvious solution.

## Stack I reach for first

```
Backend     →  PHP · Laravel · Python · Node.js
AI / ML     →  Computer Vision · LLM integration · OpenAI APIs
Mobile      →  Flutter / Dart
Database    →  MySQL · Redis
```

## What's been running in the background lately

- **serverAi** — AI-powered server-side automation
- **zebelAi / syncAi / controllerAi** — a bunch of experiments where AI does the boring parts
- **pfandbox** — cross-platform mobile app (Flutter)
- **vscube** — TypeScript project, still cooking
- **filters** — Laravel package for cleaner query filtering *(public, ships to prod)*
